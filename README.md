# Square-Root-Calculator
This JavaScript program prompts the user to input a number and then calculates and displays the square root of the absolute value of that number.
It employs the Math.abs() function to ensure the input number is treated as positive, and then computes the square root using the exponentiation operator ** and the fractional power 1/2. This tool can be handy for quickly finding square roots of numbers within a web-based environment.
